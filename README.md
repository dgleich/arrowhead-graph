Updating the Lake Arrowhead graph
=================================

A collaborative project to update the Householder Collaboration graph 
from the Lake Arrowhead meeting. [The original is hosted on John Gilbert's
old Xerox PARC page.](ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/gilbert/graph.html).

This repository has three main files and a set of analysis codes.

* arrowhead-links.txt : the original links 
* arrowhead-missing.txt : links that should have been in the original
   because there was a coauthored paper between the two authors
* arrowhead-new.txt : new links after the 1993 Householder meeting
*
